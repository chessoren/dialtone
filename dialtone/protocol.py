"""DIALTONE v1: a spoken handshake + mode switch for agent-to-agent phone calls.

Why spoken: the only channel two voice agents are guaranteed to share is the
audio. No SIP headers survive PSTN hops, and the calling agent (CALL-E) is a
hosted black box whose behaviour we steer through its task text. So the
protocol is a short phrase that survives TTS -> phone codec -> STT, plus a
3-digit nonce so an acknowledgement is provably a *response* to this call and
not a coincidence.

  caller  : "... I'm an AI assistant calling for Oren. Dialtone one, code four seven two."
  agent   : "Dialtone one acknowledged, code four seven two. Automated agent. Human review: no."
  -> both switch to MACHINE MODE (key: value fields, no small talk)
  human   : "Sorry, what?"  -> caller stays in HUMAN MODE (full disclosure, slow pace)

The acknowledgement's "Human review" field is what the attestation gate reads:
an agent saying "confirmed" is an assertion; only a human, a system record, or
a verifiable artifact turns it into something a principal can rely on.
