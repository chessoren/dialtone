"""The counterpart AI line: an inbound voicebot on a free Vapi US number.

This is the stand-in for an inbound voicebot (the kind AI Rudder answers calls
with). One number, several personas; `use` re-points the number before a test
call. Personas:

  dialtone   reservation voicebot that speaks DIALTONE v1 and gives a confirmation code
  plain      the same business, no protocol - detection must work on behaviour alone
  yesbot     a sycophantic voicebot with no booking system: it "confirms" anything
  ivr        a menu-style phone tree, emulated on the same line (labelled as emulated)
